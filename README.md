Hello,

I'm getting a BI in Computer Security and before beginning school I did seven years in the Air Force as an A-10 Avionics Technician. I have never used Github before so this is a new experience so hopefully I can figure it out rather quick as this is way more involved than other IDE's I've used in the past.
